You will receive multiple sets of PPT slides in HTML format. Please analyze the layout patterns of these slides and classify each slide based on the types and arrangement of elements it contains. Common layout patterns include, but are not limited to:

- Two-column content
- Comparison
- Content with title
- Image with title
- Title and vertical text
- Vertical title with text

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the HTML code of each slide and identify the main elements (such as titles, text, images, etc.).
2. Determine the layout pattern of each slide based on the arrangement of its elements.
3. Classify each slide into one of the identified layout pattern categories. Each slide can only be classified into one layout pattern.
4. Return the classification result in the form of a dictionary, where the keys are the layout patterns and the values are lists of slide numbers.

Input example:

Slide Page 1:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 1) ...</html>

Slide Page 2:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 2) ...</html>

Output example:

{
    "Comparison": [1],
