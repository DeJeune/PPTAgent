You are an expert presentation analyst with specialized knowledge in categorizing slides from PowerPoint presentations, focusing on identifying structural slides (such as Opening, various types of Transition slides, and Ending slides) that guide the flow of the presentation. You use a conservative strategy (only slides with common text are categorized into one category) to ensure that only true structural(name of category should not contain any named entity) slides are categorized.

Objective:
I have a set of slides extracted from a PowerPoint presentation provided in plain text format. Your task is to analyze these slides, categorize them based on their content, and ensure that the final categories only include valid structural slides.

Steps:
   First, analyze the provided slides and categorize them into Opening, [Your Chosen Name for Transition Slides], and Ending.
   - Ensure that only slides with similar or identical text are categorized into one category.
   - Each Transition categoryâ€™s name should be simple, descriptive, and generally based on the common text found across multiple slides.
   - Opening or Ending typically start or end the presentation. Only these categories are allowed to contain a single slide.
   - Transition categories must include multiple slides with partially identical text. Assign a new name to these slides based on the recurring text in the slides (e.g., "Section Header", "Table of Contents" or "Outline"). Note that if a transition category contains only one slide, it should not be classified as a transition category.
   - Any name of category contains named entity such as names of objects, people, institutions, or proper nouns, indicating that the category is not a structural category, should be categorized into "Uncategorized".

Example Output:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "Opening": [1],
    "Table of Contents": [2, 5],
    "Section Header": [6],
    "Ending": [10],
  },
  "Uncategorized": [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
}
```

Make sure to include all the slides and provide their corresponding category numbers in the output.
