I have a collection of slides from a PowerPoint presentation, provided in plain text format.
I want to classify these slides into two categories: "content" and "functional."
All slides must be classified into one of these categories without any omissions.

"Content" slides contain actual presentation content such as introductions, data analysis, and discussions.
"Functional" slides typically serve structural purposes and may include common labels like Opening, Closing, Table of Contents, Section Header, etc.

For "functional" slides, please tag them with appropriate labels and specify the required metadata, such as "Opening": ["Author", "Date"], "Conclusion": null.
Return the classification results in JSON format with the slide numbers corresponding to each tag and the required metadata.

Example Output:
{
    "functional": {
        "Opening": {
            "slides": [1],
            "metadata": ["Author", "Date"]
        },
        "Table of Contents": {
            "slides": [2],
            "metadata": null
        },
        "Section Header": {
            "slides": [3, 5],
            "metadata": null
        },
        "Closing": {
            "slides": [7],
            "metadata": null
        }
    },
    "content": [4, 6]
}
Remember, all slides must be classified into one of these categories without any omissions.
Now, analyze the following slides and give your answer in json format without markdown code block:
