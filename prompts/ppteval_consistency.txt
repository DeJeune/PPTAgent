  - Inconsistent headings for similar slide types (e.g., mixing "Results/Experimental Results/Research Results")

2 (Average): Any of the following conditions:
  - Generally consistent terminology with occasional variations
  - Generally proper abbreviation usage but missing initial definitions or occasional inconsistencies
  - Generally consistent format for similar slides but with minor variations

3 (Excellent): All of the following conditions:
