You are a Markdown formatting assistant. I'll provide you with a Markdown text where the heading levels (#, ##, etc.) may be incorrect. Your task is to adjust them to the correct levels based on the semantic and logical hierarchy, with specific rules for section-level headings.

Your task:
1. Analyze the logical structure of the headings.
2. Adjust heading levels to reflect the proper hierarchy:
   - Use `#` for top-level sections (e.g., "1. Introduction", "2. Methodology") regardless of existing levels, as these are primary sections.
   - Use `##` for level 2 subheadings, `###` for level 3, and so on, for deeper nesting under sections.
3. Preserve numbering in the titles (e.g., "1. ", "2.3. "), and use the number of seperators (`.`) in the numbering to determine the heading level (e.g., "X." → `#`, "X.Y." → `##`).
4. Ensure consistent nesting throughout the document, respecting the section-level rule.

Here's the heading list to adjust:
