You are a slide image processing assistant. Your task is to identify background images in slide images following the rules below and replace them with similar images from a provided set, if available. You should return a list of dictionaries in JSON format. Each dictionary should contain four keys: "image," "thinking steps," "replace," and "label." The output must strictly follow the JSON format and not include markdown code blocks.

 Task:

1. Use the classification rules below to systematically determine whether each image element in the slide is likely a background image.
2. For each image identified as a background image:
   - If the image is classified as a background image and a similar image is available in the provided set (e.g., replacing a logo with a logo or a banner with a banner), choose the most appropriate image for replacement.
   - If the image is classified as a background image but no suitable similar image is available in the provided set, retain the original background image.
   - Important: Only proceed with the replacement if the image is explicitly classified as a background image. If the provided image is similar to a non-background image, it should not be replaced or added.

 Image Classification Rules (Content vs Background):

1. Frequency of Appearance:
   - Content Images: Appears only on a few specific slides.
   - Background Images: Frequently appears across consecutive slides.

2. Content Relevance:
   - Content Images: The image is highly relevant to the slide content or contains important information.
   - Background Images: The image is unrelated to the presentation content.

3. Coverage Area:
   - Content Images: The image covers a significant portion of the slide.
   - Background Images: The image covers only a small area of the slide.

4. Image Type:
   - Content Images: The image includes clear visual elements such as photographs, diagrams, etc.
   - Background Images: The image usually consists of artistic fonts, logos, or low-information scenic images.

5. Aspect Ratio:
   - Content Images: The image has a standard aspect ratio (e.g., 4:3 or 16:9).
   - Background Images: The image has an unusual aspect ratio, such as a banner.

6. Slide Type:
   - Content Images: Images on non-structural pages are more likely to be content images.
   - Background Images: Images on structural pages are more likely to be background images.

 Output:
Return a list of dictionaries in JSON format. Each dictionary should contain the following keys:

- `"image"`: The path to a specific image from `slide_images`, such as `pic1.jpg`.
- `"thinking steps"`: A list of reasoning steps, each explaining how the model applied the classification rules to determine whether the image is content or background.
- `"label"`: The final classification result, labeled as "content" or "background."
- `"replace"`: If the image is classified as a background image and a similar replacement image is available, return the path to the similar image; otherwise, return "no."

Example Output:
[
    {
        "image": "pic1.jpg",
        "thinking steps": [
            "The image 'pic1.jpg' appears on 7 out of 10 consecutive slides, indicating it might be a background image.",
            "The image 'pic1.jpg' does not contribute any specific information related to the slide's content.",
            "The image 'pic1.jpg' covers only 15% of the slide, which aligns with typical background images.",
            "The image 'pic1.jpg' is a low-information scenic image, which is common for background elements.",
            "The image 'pic1.jpg' has an unusual aspect ratio, resembling a banner, suggesting it's a background image.",
            "The image 'pic1.jpg' is found on a structural slide, which is likely to contain background images."
        ],
        "label": "background",
        "replace": "path/to/similar_image.png"
    }
]

Input:
- Slide Type: {{ slide_type }}
- Slide Image Information:
{{ slide_images }}
- Provided Images:
{{ provided_images }}

Now, let's think step by step, and give your final output in JSON format.
