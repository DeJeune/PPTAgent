Task:

1. Identify which image elements in the slide image are likely background images.
2. For each identified background image:
   - If there is a similar image in the provided set (e.g., replacing a logo with a logo, or a banner with a banner), choose the most appropriate image for replacement.
   - If there is no similar image available in the provided set, retain the original background image.

Output:

Return a JSON object containing two fields without markdown code block:
- `"replace"`: A list of mappings for the replaced images. Each mapping should include `"old_image_path"` and `"new_image_path"`, representing the original image being replaced and the new image being used.
- `"background"`: A list of paths for all images identified as background images that were not replaced.

Example Output:
{
  "replace": [
    {"old_image_path": "path/to/old/logo.png", "new_image_path": "path/to/new/logo.png"},
    {"old_image_path": "path/to/old/banner.jpg", "new_image_path": "path/to/new/banner.jpg"}
  ],
  "background": [
    "path/to/old/background.jpg"
  ]
}
