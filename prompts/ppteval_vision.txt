  - Inconsistent spacing between elements of the same level
  - Minor alignment issues
  - Uneven margin distribution
3 (Excellent): All of the following conditions:
  - Neat element arrangement with consistent spacing
  - Proper alignment with clear structure
  - Even and appropriate white space

2. Visual Design:
Evaluate the visual effect and emphasis of information.

Scoring Criteria:

  - Plain visual effect, lacking design sense
3 (Excellent): All of the following conditions:

  - Natural and smooth visual guidance
  - Harmonious and unified visual effect

3. Content Presentation:
Evaluate text expression and text-image coordination.

  - Refined and readable text
  - Images appropriately supporting the topic
  - Clear and powerful overall expression

Please review the slide and output scores for the three dimensions in JSON format, with a reason for each score in less than 50 characters.
