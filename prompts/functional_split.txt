I have a collection of slides from a PowerPoint presentation, provided in HTML format. I want to classify these slides into two categories: "Content Slides" and "Auxiliary Slides". All slides must be classified into one of these categories without any omissions.

"Content Slides" contain actual presentation content such as introductions, data analysis, and discussions. "Auxiliary Slides" typically serve structural purposes and include items like the table of contents, section headers, opening and closing slides, and acknowledgments.

For "Auxiliary Slides", please tag them with one of the following labels:

"Opening" for opening slides
"Closing" for closing or thank-you slides
"Table of Contents" for slides listing the titles of sections and subsections
"Section Header" for slides marking the beginning of sections
Slides with large headings, lists of items with numbers or bullet points, or phrases like "Welcome", "Thank You", "Agenda", "Outline", "Table of Contents", and similar should be considered as "Auxiliary Slides". Additionally, slides that contain bullet points with very little text and big font sizes should also be considered as "Auxiliary Slides".

Return the classification results in JSON format with the slide numbers corresponding to each tag.

Here are some example slides:
Slide Page 1:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 1) ...</html>
Slide Page 2:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 2) ...</html>
Slide Page 3:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 3) ...</html>
Slide Page 4:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 4) ...</html>
Slide Page 5:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 5) ...</html>
Slide Page 6:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 6) ...</html>
Slide Page 7:
<html>... (HTML code of slide 7) ...</html>
Example Output:
{
    "Auxiliary Slides": {
        "Opening": [1],
        "Table of Contents": [2],
        "Section Header": [3,5],
        "closing": [7]
    },
    "Content Slides": [4,6]
}
Remember, All slides must be classified into one of these categories without any omissions.
