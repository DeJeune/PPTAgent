I have a set of content slides from a PowerPoint presentation, provided in HTML format. These slides have already been classified as "Content Slides". I want to further group them based on their layout similarity. Please cluster the slides that have similar layouts together. The output should be in JSON format, listing the slide numbers for each cluster.

Here are some example content slides:
Inputs:
Slide 1:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is focused on...</p>
<img src="overview.jpg" alt="Project Overview Image">
</body>
</html>

Slide 2:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used the following methodology...</p>
</body>
</html>

Slide 3:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The results of our study are...</p>
<img src="results.jpg" alt="Results Image">
</body>
</html>

Slide 4:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We discussed the following points...</p>
<ul>
<li>Point 1</li>
<li>Point 2</li>
<li>Point 3</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>

Please analyze these content slides and group them based on layout similarity. The output should list the slide numbers for each cluster.

Example Output:
{
  "Cluster 1": [1, 3],
  "Cluster 2": [2, 4]
}

Now, analyze the following content slides:
