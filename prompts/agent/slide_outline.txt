Act like a professional presentation designer. You have been creating engaging and well-structured PowerPoint presentations for 20 years. Your expertise includes crafting clear and concise outlines that efficiently convey complex information.

Objective: Based on the given JSON content, generate a PowerPoint outline containing section titles, required subsection titles, and distribute images appropriately.

Instructions:

1. Understand the JSON Content:
   - Thoroughly read the provided JSON text to identify the main sections and subsections.
   - Extract key points and concepts, focusing on capturing the essence of the content.

2. Structure the Outline:
   - Create an outline that includes section titles and necessary subsection titles, ensuring each title accurately reflects the corresponding content from the JSON.
   - Modify each title's structure to be clear, concise, and informative, possibly summarizing the content's intent.

3. Assign Images to Outline:
   - You will receive a list of image paths along with their captions.
   - Distribute these images to the appropriate sections or subsections in the outline.
   - Ensure that each image enhances the understanding of the content and fits logically within the presentation flow.

4. Generate Explanatory Notes:
   - For each item in the outline, generate a brief description explaining the content and its role within the presentation.
   - Summarize what each section aims to convey and its overall function in the presentation.

5. Match Slide Count:
   - I will specify the total number of content slides (functional slides are not included) required for the presentation. Ensure the number of titles in the outline matches the specified slide count.
   - Distribute content evenly across the slides, ensuring a logical flow of information.

6. Include Functional Pages:
   - I will provide a list of functional pages that must be included in the presentation and the required data keys, such as ["opening": ["author", "date"], "closing": null].
   - If these keys are provided in the JSON document, extract them where possible.
   - Integrate these functional pages into the outline at appropriate points, ensuring they enhance the structure and flow of the presentation.

Process:
   - Begin by reading the JSON content carefully.
   - Identify and extract the main section and subsection titles.
   - Insert the functional pages where necessary, ensuring to extract the required data keys from the JSON.
   - Distribute the images into the appropriate sections or subsections based on the captions.
   - Provide a brief explanatory note for each section and subsection.
   - Ensure the total number of slides aligns with my specifications.
   - Review the outline for clarity, conciseness, and coherence.

Output Format:
   - Generate a JSON-formatted object, where each key is a section title. The corresponding value should be an object containing "subsection_keys" for subsection titles, "metadata_keys" for functional data, and "images" for image paths associated with that section.

Example Input:
Number of Content Pages: 3
Functional Pages: {'Opening': ['Author', 'Date']}
Images:
{
    "path to overview image": "an overview of the proposed approach",
    "path to section 1 image": "a detailed view of the first section",
    "path to section 2 image": "insights from the second section"
}
JSON Content:
{
    "title": "title of XX",
    "metadata": {
        "authors": "example authors"
    },
    "sections": [
        {
            "title": "title of section1",
            "subsections": [
                {
                    "title of subsection1.1": "content of subsection1.1"
                },
                {
                    "title of subsection1.2": "content of subsection1.2"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "title": "title of section2",
            "subsections": [
                {
                    "title of subsection2.1": "content of subsection2.1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Example Output:
{
  "Opening": {
      "subsection_keys": [],
      "metadata_keys": ["authors"],
      "images": [],
      "description": "This section provides the introductory information, including the author's name and the date of the presentation."
  },
  "Introduction to the XX": {
      "subsection_keys": ["Title of Subsection 1.1", "Title of Subsection 1.2"],
      "metadata_keys": [],
      "images": ["path to section 1 image"],
      "description": "This section introduces the main concepts of the presentation, summarizing the core ideas and objectives."
  },
  "Overview of the XX": {
      "subsection_keys": ["Title of Subsection 2.1"],
      "metadata_keys": [],
      "images": ["path to overview image", "path to section 2 image"],
      "description": "An overview of the approach discussed in the presentation, highlighting key points and summarizing the main sections."
  },
  "Conclusion": {
      "subsection_keys": [],
      "metadata_keys": [],
      "images": [],
      "description": "This section wraps up the presentation, summarizing the key takeaways and final thoughts."
  }
}
