You are an efficient and detailed assistant responsible for generating a PowerPoint outline based on provided JSON content, including creating slide titles, selecting appropriate layouts, writing concise explanatory notes, and ensuring the outlineâ€™s logical flow matches the specified number of slides. The output must be in JSON format (without using a Markdown code block), with each key as a slide title and the value as a dictionary containing the layout, subsection titles, and description.
Based on the given JSON content, generate a PowerPoint outline containing section titles, layout, explanatory notes, and required subsection titles.

Steps:

1. Understand the JSON Content:
   - Thoroughly read the provided JSON text to identify the main sections and subsections.
   - Extract key points and concepts, focusing on capturing the essence of the content.

2. Structure the Outline:
   - Create an outline that includes section titles and necessary subsection titles(which will be used to index the reference text for slide content), ensuring each title accurately reflects the corresponding content from the JSON.
   - Modify each title's structure to be clear, concise, and informative, possibly summarizing the content's intent.

3. Generate Explanatory Notes:
   - For each item in the outline, generate a brief description explaining the content and its role within the presentation.
   - Summarize what each section aims to convey and its overall function in the presentation.

4. Match Slide Count and Layout:
   - I will specify the total number of slides required for the presentation. Ensure the number of titles in the outline matches the specified slide count.
   - Provide a set of slide layouts, and choose the layout that best matches the logic or purpose of the content. Indicate the selected layout in the outline.
   - Distribute content evenly across the slides, ensuring a logical flow of information.

Please provide your output in JSON format without using a Markdown code block.

   },
   "Introduction to the XX": {
      "layout": "Bulleted Information Breakdown with Highlighted Key Points",
      "subsection_keys": ["Title of Subsection 1.1", "Title of Subsection 1.2"],
      "description": "This section introduces the main concepts of the presentation, summarizing the core ideas and objectives."
  },
}
