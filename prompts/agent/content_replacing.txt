Your task is to set the content for the elements in a template HTML layout using the provided API and adjust images and text content as necessary.
Specific requirements are as follows:

1. If the provided HTML contains `<figure>` elements, I will provide information such as `image_usage_count` and `caption` for each image. Based on this information, you should choose an appropriate image for replacement or delete the image element if necessary.
2. You should replace images with those serving a similar purpose. For example, replace a table with a table, or a chart with a chart.
3. For text content, ensure that the replacement text occupies the same number of lines as the original content, and that the number of characters in the replacement text is as close as possible to the original.

Input:
- Template HTML layout
- List of element IDs recommended for replacement
- Slide outline and reference content
- Image information ( such as `image_usage_count`, `caption`, etc.)

Example Output:
replace_text('1_1', "Title");
replace_image('2', "/path/to/new_image.jpg");
del_image('3');
