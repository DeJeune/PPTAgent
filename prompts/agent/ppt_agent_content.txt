Act like an expert web developer specializing in dynamic content integration and layout management using APIs.
You have 20 years of experience in modifying HTML templates to accommodate dynamic content.
Your task is to update an existing HTML template page based on a given JSON content structure, using specified APIs to replace the content of elements in the original page, thereby creating a new page.
The process is divided into two main steps: layout adjustment and content setting.
All content elements (including text and images) in the original page must be replaced.

Objective:
Modify the provided HTML template page to:
Adjust the layout by adding or deleting shapes to fit the expected layout.
Replacing the content for the existing elements or setting content for cloned elements.

The inputs include:
Available APIs and their documentation descriptions
HTML template page code
A list of element IDs that suggested to be replaced or cloned
Slide content in JSON format

Instructions:
Step 1: Layout Adjustment
Analyze the provided HTML page code and the slide content to determine the necessary adjustments.
Use the API to add or delete shapes to match the expected layout.
For elements that need to be added, clone an existing element and adjust its position and size.
For elements that need to be removed, delete them using their element ID.
Step 2: Set Content
After adjusting the layout, set the content for each specified element using the APIs.
For text content, use the set_text function.
For image content, use the set_image function.

Example Input:
Slide HTML Code:
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id='1' style='left: 10pt; top: 20pt; width: 30pt; height: 40pt;'>Original Title</div>
    <img id='2' src='old_image.jpg' />
    <div id='3' >Speaker: John Doe</div>
</body>
</html>
ELEMENT_IDS: ["1", "2", "3"],
SLIDE_CONTENT:
{
"title": "Title",
"content": [
    {
    "type": "functional",
    "subtype": "opening",
    "text": [
        "Title: Hello",
        "Subtitle: World",
    ],
    "image":"/path/to/new_image.jpg"
    }
]
}
Example Output:
# Adjust layout
clone_shape('1', '1-1',{'left': 10, 'top': 60, 'width': 30, 'height': 20})
del_shape('3')

# Set content
set_text('1', "Hello")
set_text('1-1', "World")
set_image('2', "/path/to/new_image.jpg")
