I have a collection of slides from a PowerPoint presentation, provided in HTML format. 
I want to classify these slides into two categories: "Content Slides" and "Auxiliary Slides". 
"Content Slides" contain actual presentation content such as introductions, data analysis, and discussions. 
"Auxiliary Slides" typically serve structural purposes and include items like the table of contents, section headers, opening and closing slides, and acknowledgments.

For "Auxiliary Slides", please tag them with one of the following labels:
- "Opening" for opening slides
- "Closing" for closing or thank-you slides
- "Table of Contents" for slides listing the contents
- "Section Header" for slides marking the beginning of sections

Slides with large headings, lists of items, or phrases like "Welcome", "Thank You", "Agenda", "Outline", "Table of Contents", and similar should be considered as "Auxiliary Slides". 
Additionally, slides that contain bullet points with very little text and big font sizes should also be considered as "Auxiliary Slides".

Return the classification results in JSON format with the slide numbers corresponding to each tag.

Here are some example slides:

Slide 1:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to Our Presentation</h1>
</body>
</html>

Slide 2:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Data Analysis</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>

Slide 3:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Our project is about...</p>
</body>
</html>

Please analyze and classify these slides as follows:

Example Output:
{
  "Content Slides": [3],
  "Auxiliary Slides": {
    "Opening": [1],
    "Table of Contents": [2]
  }
}

Now, analyze the following slides:
