**iPhone 16 Pro is built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.**

**Boost your productivity Express yourself visually A new era for Siri**

**Explore new tools that help you write, focus, and communicate.**

**Make a Genmoji right in the keyboard to match any conversation. Want to create a disco ball pigeon? You got it. Just provide a description. Awareness of your personal context enables Siri to help you in ways that are unique to you. Need your passport number while booking a flight? Siri can help find what you're looking for, without compromising your privacy. Writing Tools can proofread your text and rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize selected text with a tap. They're available nearly everywhere you write, including thirdparty apps.**

**The Image Playground app lets you create unique images in seconds based on a description, a concept, or even a person from your Photos library. Experiment with image styles like animation, illustration, and sketch. Richer language understanding and an enhanced voice make communicating with Siri even more natural. For example, if you stumble over your words, Siri still knows what you're getting at. Just hit record in the Notes or Phone app to capture audio recordings and transcripts. Apple Intelligence generates summaries of your transcripts, so you can get the most important info at a glance.**

**With Clean Up, you can remove distracting background objects from your photos with just a tap — so you can perfect a shot while staying true to the original image. Not sure how to do something on iPhone, like adjust the background blur on a portrait? With expansive product knowledge, Siri can give you step-by-step instructions in a snap. Priority messages in Mail elevate timesensitive messages to the top of your inbox — like an invitation that has a deadline today or a check-in reminder for your flight this afternoon.**

## **Great powers come with great privacy.**

**Apple Intelligence is designed to protect your privacy at every step. It's integrated into the core of iPhone through on-device processing. So it's aware of your personal information without collecting your personal information.**

**And with groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can draw on larger Apple-designed server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.**
