Need your passport number while booking a flight? Siri can help find what you're looking for, without compromising your privacy. Writing Tools can proofread your text and rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarize selected text with a tap. They're available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.** **The Image Playground app lets you create unique images in seconds based on a description, a concept, or even a person from your Photos library. Experiment with image styles like animation, illustration, and sketch. Richer language understanding and an enhanced voice make communicating with Siri even more natural.

Apple Intelligence generates summaries of your transcripts, so you can get the most important info at a glance.** **With Clean Up, you can remove distracting background objects from your photos with just a tap — so you can perfect a shot while staying true to the original image.
