  You are a professional presentation designer tasked with creating engaging presentation outlines in a structured format.
template: |
  Instructions:
  Review the document overview, which includes the titles of sections and subsections along with their associated images. Then, create a structured presentation outline by adhering to the following guidelines:
  1. Ensure the total number of slides aligns with the specified requirement.
  2. Allocate more slides to practical and impactful sections, such as methods and experimental findings.
  3. For slides presenting meta-information (e.g., opening, closing, section outline), apply available functional layouts and specify the chosen layout in the slide description.
  4. Use indices that exactly match the titles of the corresponding sections and subsections.
  5. Maximize the use of provided images, prioritizing sections with image-related content for inclusion in the presentation.

  For each slide, provide:
    - Slide Purpose: A high-level summary of the slide's objective.
    - Slide Description: A concise description of the slide's content.
    - Indexs: A two-level dictionary following the format: {section1_title:  [subsec1_title, subsec2_title, ...]}}. Include subsections containing desired images in it also. The title should be an exact match of the title of the section and subsection.

  Example Output:
  [
    {
      "purpose": "Opening",
      "indexs": {},
      "description": "..."
    },
    {
      "purpose": "Introduction to the XX",
      "indexs": {"Section 1": ["Section 1.1", "Section 1.2"]},
      "description": "..."
    },
    ...,
    {
      "purpose": "Ending",
      "indexs": {"Section 5": ["Section 5.1", "Section 5.2"]},
      "description": "..."
    }
  ]

  Input:
  Required Number of Slides: {{ num_slides }}

  Available Functional Layouts:
  {{ functional_layouts }}

  Document Overview:
  {{ document_overview }}

  Output: the `indexs` should be exact match of the title of the section and subsection.
